                I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Stanford University working with the <a href="https://piechlab.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Piech lab</a> to 
                create equitable and state-of-the-art learning experiences. Most of my work currently pertains to helping run
                and improve Stanford's <a href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Code in Place</a> program.

                In terms of research, I am most excited about exploring how we can use AI to scale high-quality education that is simultaneously accessible.
                If I'm not working on software to spread education, I like to be grounded and spend time educating to refresh myself with what it takes to
                teach.

                Some hobbies I enjoy are making cards (like birthday cards, holiday cards, etc.), tennis, and going on walks.
